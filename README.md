For this project, I used Grid instead of absolute positioning to build most of the overlapping content as it makes building all the layout much less clunky, and the code remains easily maintainable as well!

I definitely enjoyed making the hover effects and animations, I also experimented with pseudo-elements and gradient patterns which were interesting to learn more about!
